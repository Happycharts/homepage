Portals are one of the main features of Happybase. They allow you to create a hosted sharing experience for your data stakeholders. By leveraging IFrame technology, Happybase portals provide a customizable and user-friendly environment for data sharing.

## What are Portals?

Portals in Happybase are customizable environments created using IFrames. These portals can be tailored to fit the specific needs of different users and applications, providing a flexible and powerful data-sharing solution.

## How Portals Work

### Customization

Portals can be endlessly customized to meet the unique requirements of different users. This includes custom branding, layouts, and functionalities. Whether you need a simple data dashboard or a complex analytics tool, Happybase portals can be adapted to suit your needs.

### Isolation

Each portal operates as an independent web page within the main Happybase interface. This isolation ensures that data and code from one portal do not interfere with others. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of your data.

## Benefits of Portals

### Flexibility

The ability to customize portals allows for a wide range of applications and use cases. Whether you're a small business owner or a large enterprise, Happybase portals can be tailored to meet your specific needs.

### Ease of Integration

Portals can easily integrate with existing web applications, making it simple to add data-sharing capabilities to your current systems. This seamless integration ensures that you can start sharing data quickly and efficiently.
